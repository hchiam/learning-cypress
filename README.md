# Learning Cypress
Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

## Do once for this project:

```bash
cd learning-cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

## Then do once per test:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

(click on a .js test file to run it - it will auto-run whenever you re-save the file)

## Sub-folder for more learning:

```bash
cd tutorial
```
