# Learning Cypress
Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

## Do once for this project:

(`cd` inside this folder first)

```
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

## Do once per test:

```
node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

(click on a .js test file to run it - it will auto-run whenever you re-save the file)
